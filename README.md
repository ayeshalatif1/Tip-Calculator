### What I learned

I learned how to build and complete a project using React, and how to effectively integrate HTML and CSS within a React environment. I also gained hands-on experience using React hooks such as useState and useEffect to manage state and handle side effects efficiently.


### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on improving my React component structuring and state management skills to make the code more scalable and maintainable. I also plan to work on form validation, error handling, and enhancing the overall user experience with better design and responsiveness.
